# Ontology-based Semantic Similarity

This repo is intended to provide methods to determine ontology-based semantic similarity. Within the functions the package [Owlready2][2] is used to work with OWL ontologies. For now it includes

* Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
* more to come ...

Among other things, the [pizza.owl][1] ontology is used to test and demonstrate ideas.
